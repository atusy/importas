# importas

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Get objects from packages via aliases of packages and the $ operator.
The `%as%` infix operator works in the way similar to Python's `Import spam as ham`

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("atusy/pkgas")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(pkgas)

# Define an alias of a package, 
# and access the object from the package via the alias
graphics %as% gr
gr$plot

# Define aliases at once
importas(utils = ut, stats = st)
ut$data
st$median
```
